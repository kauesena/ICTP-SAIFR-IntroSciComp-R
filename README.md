# ICTP-SAIFR/Serrapilheira — Introduction to Scientific Programming (R) - 2022
Demo project developed during the classes of the course Introduction to Scientific Programming of the Serrapilheira/ICTP-SAIFR Training Program in Quantitative Biology and Ecology (to which the organisers referred as Computational Methods [a bit confusingly]). Here the code shall be in R. There is another repository with the same mostly the same code translated to Julia.

The first part of the class is being taught by Sara Mortara. The second part will be taught by Andrea Sánchez-Tapia. Perhaps their parts and Ricardo Cerri part are collectively referred to as _Computational Methods_ but only Sara and Andrea are articulated. Who knows?
